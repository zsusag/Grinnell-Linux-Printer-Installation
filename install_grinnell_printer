# Emacs: This is a -*- Shell-script -*-

# After installing the Papercut software on a GNU/Linux
# workstation, this script installs and configures the desired
# printers on the Grinnell College network.
# Note: This script needs to be run by the root user as
#       adding printers in CUPS needs to be done by and
#       administrator.
